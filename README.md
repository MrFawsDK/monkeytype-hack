## Credits

This project is based partly on code from [fin-github/monkeytype-hack](https://github.com/fin-github/monkeytype-hack).

The original project provided the initial concept and parts of the codebase. The code has since been rewritten and modified with updated Selenium handling, Chrome support, active-word detection, safer configuration parsing, and improved error handling.

Credit goes to [fin-github](https://github.com/fin-github) for the original implementation.
